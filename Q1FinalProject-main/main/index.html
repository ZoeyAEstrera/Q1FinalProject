            <h2>What Causes Bad Education</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons on what causes bad education. One is having insufficient resources, for example schools in underfunded areas, they could lack the neccesary resources needed for their students like books, school supplies, and technology. Another is having economic inequality, like in poverty, these people that come from low-income families may struggle to find a way to pay for their student's basic needs for school, transportation everyday, or the tuition fees. My final example will be from people that were affected by natural disasters, just like during earthuakes, education while looking out for when an earthquake will hit will hinder the student's performance in their academics, or maybe because of their families being affected by that natural disaster causing them to not be able to attend classes or because of damage or because they were forced to relocate.</p>
